# MongoDB Aggregation: Handling Missing Foreign Keys in $lookup and $unwind

This repository demonstrates a potential issue when using MongoDB's `$lookup` and `$unwind` operators together.  The `$lookup` stage performs a join operation, and `$unwind` is used to deconstruct arrays.  However, if the `foreignField` specified in `$lookup` does not exist in the target collection, this could lead to unexpected errors or empty results. This example highlights the problem and its resolution using the `preserveNullAndEmptyArrays` option in the `$unwind` stage. 

## Problem
The `$unwind` stage will throw an error if the array is empty or if no matches are found with the `$lookup` stage. This occurs because the `$unwind` operator expects an array to process.  Without any matches, the `results` array is empty, resulting in an error.  The solution addresses this by preserving null or empty arrays using the `preserveNullAndEmptyArrays` option in `$unwind`.

## Solution
Adding the `preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: true` option to the `$unwind` stage ensures that empty or null arrays are handled gracefully, preventing errors and preserving relevant documents even when no match is found in the join operation.
